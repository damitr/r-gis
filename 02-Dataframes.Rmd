# Dataframe Function

A `dataframe` is a list of vectors and or factors of the same length which are related across rows.

We have earlier seen how to make a dataframe using `c()` function. Data frames are one of the most versatile data objects in R. Data frames allow us to combine various types of data into a single object. Using R functions we can explore data frames, filter and group data and manipulate (in the right manner ðŸ˜€) data to get desired results.

R has several inbuilt datasets which we can use to learn about its functions.

## Packages

Let us install the required packages. First we will install various dataset packages.

```{r}

# packages for datasets 
install.packages("dslabs")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("LearnBayes")


```

We will also install another package \`tidyverse\`. The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in
everyday data analyses. There are eight packages in \`tidyverse\`, but we will be primarily using these three packages initially.

-   \`ggplot2\` (grammar of graphics for creating graphics)

-   \`dplyr\` ( grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges)

-   \`tidyr\` (tidyr provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable.)

Tidyverse provides improved replacements for some base R functions.

More information at <https://www.tidyverse.org/>

```{r}


# packages for various functions 

install.packages("tidyverse")

# tidyvese is a collection of packages which provide a variety of functions to explore, manipulate and visualise data. 

```

Now installing packages is the first step. To use the packages we need to load them into R. For loading a package we use the \`library()\` function.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(LearnBayes)


```

Now within the `LearnBayes` we have several datasets. To see the datasets in a library we will use `data()`
command. But using use `data()` will give **all** the datasets installed on your R system. 

To see a datasets in a specific library we specify to `data()` that we want only this library.

```{r}


data(package = "LearnBayes")
```

This command will list all the datasets in the `LearnBayes` library. We will use some of the datasets to explore. We will use the dataset `studentdata`. To load this dataset we use `data()` command

```{r}

data("studentdata")

```

To "see" how this dataset is structured there are several commands that we can use. Let us start with the `str()` command which shows us the structure of a dataframe.


# Exploratory data analysis

## Stem plot Function

Stem plot was invented by John Tukey,

```{r}

library(datasets)
data("iris")

str(iris)
```

Now let us look at stem plot with this data set.

```{r}
stem(iris$Sepal.Width)
hist(iris$Sepal.Width)

```
